# Script'o'Matic

## Overview
Script'o'Matic is a program made to create scripts for running a number of executables, defined in the creating script process.

## Goals
Script'o'Matic is made to:
- Create scripts as an installer (for fresh OS installs)
- Create scripts as an executable (run N times a file / some files)
- Read scripts created previously
- Edit scripts for newer adds / changes for updates / deleting an entry
- Create a stand-alone program that includes JRE and Jar Executable (for platforms lacking of JRE installed in first place)

## Platform
Script'o'Matic is available on all JRE-ready platforms. Java 8 is the lastest x86 library supported, meanwhile Java 11 is the lastest one on 64bit machines. The program will be written as a mix of Java 7/8, waiting to be improved later.
